# Tic-Tac-Toe-
This repository contains a simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game written in HTML,CSS and Javascript. It allows two players to play the game on the command line interface.
Features:
Two players can play the game.
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Players take turns marking their moves (X or O) on the grid.
The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
If all the spaces on the grid are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
The game provides a command line interface for players to enter their moves.
